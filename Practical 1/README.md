The final version of all code can be found in 'Practical 1_full.ipynb'.
To make this code run correctly, the following files should be placed in the same folder as the notebook: SimLex-999.txt, MEN_dataset_natural_form_full, bow2.words, bow5.words, deps.words, questions-words.txt, and 2000_nouns_sorted.txt

Running this whole file will run all of the code discussed in the report, except for the "Word Analogy Task" part, where [MODEL = 'deps'] should be changed to the desired model.

If so desired, [get_topk("deps.words", 'usa', 5)] can be changed to test other words and/or a different number of top words (also for bow5 and bow2).
